ðŸ§¬ *Project Description â€“ Gene Expression Explorer* 

Gene Expression Explorer is a web-based tool designed to help researchers and healthcare professionals analyze and understand gene expression data. This data shows how active or inactive genes are in different people â€” especially when comparing healthy individuals to those with diseases like cancer, diabetes, etc.

The tool uses public data from the NCBI GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus), a large online database of gene activity collected from real experiments. By selecting a dataset that compares healthy vs disease samples, our tool performs the following key tasks:


 *What the Tool Does* :

1. Load and Clean Data

Accesses gene expression datasets using Python and GEOparse.

2. Analyze Gene Differences

Identifies which genes behave differently in healthy vs diseased samples.

3. Predict Disease Status

Uses machine learning to classify samples as healthy or diseased.

4. Show Results Visually

Displays charts and graphs for easy understanding.

5. Simple Web Interface

Allows users to explore and search gene data easily.


ðŸŽ¯ *Why This Project Matters* 

1)Bridges biology and computer science (bioinformatics)

2)Helps in early disease detection and research

3)Promotes the use of open science and real data

4)Supports healthcare innovations using technology**Use GitHub Codespaces**
